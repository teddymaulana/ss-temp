          <h3>What do I need to use Promo?</h3>

          <p>All you need is an iPhone or Android with an internet connection (data or wifi). You will use the Promo application to create and manage your online marketing efforts. Your customers and potential customers will interact and engage with your promotions in web browsers, via sms and emails. </p>


          <h3>Is my data safe and secure with Promo? How are payments handled?</h3>
          
          <p>We take security, credit cards, and customer data extremely seriously. Promo is PCI compliant and all payments are handled using 256kb SSL encryption. Payments are processed using your choice of Paypal or Stripe.

          <h3>How much does Promo cost?</h3>
          
          <p>Promo offers several different packages to cater businesses of all shapes and sizes. We offer a free trial. View our <a href="http://promo.co/pricing">pricing page</a> for more details.</p>


          <h3>Are there any long term contracts?</h3>
          
          <p>Nope. At any time you may upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your account.</p>


          <h3>Can I add/embed a promo on any website?</h3>

          <p>Absolutely. In fact, we recommend adding promos to your own website. For added reach, encourage your customers, followers, and friends to embed your promotion across the web.</p>

          <p>We offer a few embed widgets available on your website footer and within individual promo pages. This is a great way to build your email list and get as many eyeballs as possible on your business.</p>

          <p>Once embedded, users can watch the video, buy now, ask a question, or subscribe for future promotion updates without leaving the page where promo is embedded. </p>


          <h3>How can I get my new leads or sales?</h3>
          
          <p>New messages are sent to the email address you used as the business contact email. Use your existing inbox to reply and manage those leads. For new sales, simply navigate to “My Orders” within the Promo app to view and fulfill your orders.
          </p>

          <h3>Do I have to use video? Can I use photos or just text?</h3>

          <p>Promo allows business owners to use a video or photo. To increase conversion rates, we recommend using a video in a well lit area to showcase your product or services. It’s core to our product. If you feel camera shy, we recommend asking a friends or co-worker to help you record a short but informative video.</p>

          
          <h3>Who are you guys?</h3>
          
          <p>Promo is based out of beautiful Vancouver, Canada. We’re passionate about small business and social commerce. To learn more about us, visit our <a href="http://promo.co/about">about us</a> page, read the promo <a href="http://blog.promo.co">blog</a>, or follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/UsePromo">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UsePromo">Fb</a>, and <a href="http://instagram.com/UsePromo">Instagram</a>.</p>

          <h3>Why did you choose the name Promo?</h3>

          <p>Before we wrote the first line of code, we knew this product had to be called Promo. Combining the obvious shortened version of the word promotion and what advertisers call a ‘short video advertisement’. A home base to launch a video promotion across the internet.. we can’t think of a better name that encapsulates the product.</p>

          <h3>How do Promotions work?</h3>

          <p>Promo allows business owners to create and distribute video or photo promotions across the internet. Potential customers can view your promotion pages by clicking on the promotion url within their desktop, tablet, or mobile browser. From there, they can watch the video, buy now, or ask a question. </p>

          <p>The business owner will receive those requests from the Promo application on their smart phone. </p>


          <h3>How do I sell on Promo?</h3>

          <p>Download the application, add your paypal or stripe payment merchant, and create a For Sale promo. Manage inventory, refunds, and customer support from the Promo application.</p>


          <h3>What can I sell on Promo?</h3>
          
          <p>The possibilities are endless but use common sense. If it’s illegal, or something you can’t show your mother, then it probably shouldn’t be on Promo. For a complete list of items you can not sell, please visit our <a href="http://promo.co/terms">terms and conditions</a> page.</p>

          <h3>Once I make my first sale, how do I ship it? What kind of packaging can I use to mail my item(s)?</h3>
          
          <p>Very good question! Your goal is for the item to arrive safely in one piece and as quickly as possible (speedy deliveries = higher potential for repeat business). We recommend using common sense when shipping items. If an item is fragile, include extra padding and air pockets to secure the item for delivery. We recommend visiting a local shipping depot to find the best packaging for your item. Alternatively, you can view the following websites that include a wealth of information in regards to preparing a package and price points:</p>

          </ul>

          <h3>How do I get the money from my sale?</h3>
          
          <p>Promo facilitates the promotion posting, sharing, stats, and fulfillment. To collect money payment, each business must use Stripe or Paypal as their merchant account. All transactions are processed and stored at the corresponding merchant account. Please refer to each service for payout policies and procedures.</p>

          <h3>Can I list an item for sale that can only be paid in person?</h3>
          
          <p>Absolutely. When creating a promo, or editing an existing promotion you can disable “online payments” so a promotion can only be listed with proper pricing, but purchased in person.</p>

          <h3>Can I sell if I don’t have a bank account?</h3>
          
          <p>You can list items for sale with Promo, but in order to collect online payments you must create a Stripe or Paypal account.</p>

          <p>All payments are paid out via email money transfer or cheque. You could technically request a cheque and cash that at any bank, but we recommend creating an account to manage and save all of the money you’ll be making through the app.</p>

          <h3>How do I refund a customer?</h3>
          
          <p>To refund an order, please visit the order list screen within the Promo application. Find the correct order and select the gear icon in the top right hand corner. From the pop-up menu, select “Refund Order” and visit the corresponding payment merchant to refund the order.</p>

          <h3>What happens if a customer requests a refund after I shipped the item?</h3>
          
          <p>Instruct the buyer to return the package for a complete refund. Once the item has been received, select Refund Order within the Order Details screen within the Promo application. See “How to refund an order” section.</p>

          <h3>How do I shop on Promo?</h3>
          
          <p>Visit <a href="http://promo.co/explore">http://promo.co/explore</a> and start watching of all of the different promotions across the network. Start asking questions or buying items that you fancy.</p>

          <h3>How do I know I’ll get my item? What happens if my seller doesn’t send my item?</h3>
          
          <p>Promo acts as a marketing platform and marketplace to connect businesses with customers. We take great pride delivering a great experience on the Promo network. If for whatever reason you have problems with a business, or a specific order, please contact the business to resolve your problem. </p>


 
          <h3>What mobile platforms is Promo available for?</h3>
                    
          <p>It's available today from the iOS App Store and the Android Play Store.</p>


          <h3>Do I need a stripe or paypal account to use Promo?</h3>
                    
          <p>No. We have customers that use Promo to list items for sale or to build leads. A great example would be for a realtor a car dealership. Those businesses would never accept online payments for such big ticket items.</p>

          <h3>What currencies do you support?</h3>
          
          <p>All currencies.</p>

          <h3>Do you support multiple users for the same business?</h3>
          <p>We sure do. Create accounts for other managers or your team. Each user will receive their own access that you can disable at any time.</p>

          <br><br>
          <h2>Website questions<h2>

          <h3>Can I use a custom domain or subdomain?</h3>
          <p>Yes, we support and encourage custom domains or cnames. Read <a href="/how_to_map_domain">'how to map my domain'</a>.</p>
                    

          <h3>Is Promo mobile optimized?</h3>
                    
          <p>Yes. We optimized for mobile first and desktop second. Your homepage will display the most important information first. Such as your hours, location, phone number, and even a map with directions.</p>


          <h3>Do my customers need to download promo or a mobile app?</h3>
                    
          <p>No. the Promo application is for business owners to manage their online marketing efforts. Customers can access promotions and your website through any internet connected device, such as a web browser on a mobile phone, tablet, desktop, or laptop. </p>

          <h3>Are websites and Promo pages optimized for Search Engines?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We've optimized both websites and promo pages to help with SEO rankings. You'll also find we've added schema markup and social media tags to improve rankings and readability across social media sites when your pages and promotions are shared.</p>

          <p>Using the Promo app, you can update your website at any time with updates appearing live on your site instantaneously. </p>

          <br><br>
          <h2>Business Listing Syndication<h2>

          <h3>What is business listing syndication?</h3>
          <p>When you update your address, phone number, or store hours, it's very time consuming to ensure that information has been updated and reflected across the web. We take that pain away by offering seamless way to update your information from one place. You update you hours, we push that update everywhere. </p>

          <h3>How do I update my listing if it’s listed somewhere incorrectly?</h3>
          <p>Start using Promo. Once you've updated your information using the Promo mobile app, we'll automatically update those incorrect listings.</p>


          <h3>What is a public promotion versus a private promotion?</h3>
          
          <p>A public promotion is available to everyone. It automatically appears on your website. This Promo type is useful for trying to drive as many people as possible to your promotion.</p>
          <p>A private promotion is for an individual customer or segment of customers. This would be good for rewarding a group of loyal customers with a unique offer to thank them, or get them back into your store front. </p>

          <p>Some businesses are using private promotions in interesting ways: to follow up with customers directly, to provide customer support, to send a personalized thank you message, etc..</p>

          <p>It really comes down to the goals of your business</p>

          <br><br>
          <h2>Email Marketing</h2>

          <h3>What is “My Email / Subscriber List?”</h3>
          <p>This is your email marketing list. When a customer buys a Promo or visits your website, they have an opportunity to subscribe to future updates by submitting their email address. Once subscribed, you can send them new promotions or future business updates every time you launch a new promotion.</p>


          <h3>How do my customers join my email / subscriber list?</h3>
          <p>Customers can subscribe by visiting your homepage or by viewing a sold out Promo.</p>


          <h3>I have an existing email list, how do I add those emails?</h3>
          <p>Please <a href="/contact">contact</a> our support team so we can add your email subscribers.</p>
