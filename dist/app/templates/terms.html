            <li>harvest or otherwise collect information about Users, including email addresses, without their consent.</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h3>3. Abusing Promo</h3>
          
          <p>Promo and our community of Users (the "Community") work together to keep our Website, Mobile Applications, Wordpress Plugin Suite, Referral Program, and Service working properly and the Community safe. Please report problems, offensive content, and policy violations to us.</p>

          <p>Without limiting other remedies, we may limit, suspend or terminate our Service and user accounts, prohibit access to our Website and content, Promotion Pages, Service and tools, delay or remove hosted content, including but not limited to Digital Goods and User Content, and take technical and legal steps to keep Users off the Website and Mobile Application if we think that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (for example, and without limitation, policies related to shill bidding, conducting off-Promo transactions, feedback manipulation, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or users who we believe are harassing our employees or other Users).</p> 

          <p>Additionally, we may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, suspend or terminate accounts of Users who may be repeat infringers of intellectual property rights of third parties. We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time, or to modify or discontinue the Website, Service, Promo Link, or tools.</p>
          
          
          <h3>4. Buyer Protection</h3>
          
          <p>Buyers of Goods or Services ("Buyers") and Sellers share the responsibility for making sure purchases facilitated by Promo are exciting, rewarding and hassle-free. Promo is happy to work with both parties to resolve any conflicts or issues that arise — support@promo.co</p>
          <p>In addition:</p>
          <p>Sellers agree to allow us to remove funds from their Promo accounts for amounts due to Buyers.
          Where there are insufficient funds in Promo accounts, we will require another reimbursement method.
          Sellers agree to allow us to charge the payment method they designate for amounts due to Buyers.
          Changing a reimbursement method will not affect Promo's use of a payment method on file for other purposes (such as payment of your Promo fees). If Sellers do not provide Promo with a valid reimbursement method, we may collect amounts owed using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies. We may also suspend or restrict Sellers from using our Service or Website until payment is made.
          Correcting Mistakes in Payments to Buyers or Sellers. We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover. We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the erroneous refund or reimbursement.</p>
          
          
          <h3>5. Holds</h3>
          
          <p>To protect against the risk of liability, Promo has the ability hold Seller funds based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history or Seller performance.
          You agree to use User information only for:
          Promo transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages;
          using services offered through Promo (such as shipping and fraud complaints), or
          other purposes that a User expressly chooses.</p>
          
          

          <h3>6. Fees and Services</h3>
          
          <p>Buyers may use our Website, Wordpress Plugin Suite and/or Service at no cost during a trial period. We do charge Sellers a fee for each sale conducted via the Service, a per transaction fee to cover merchant costs (the "Fees"). We also offer a tiered pricing plan to fit your needs and buget. When you list Goods, you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged based on our <!-- <a href="http://promo.co/pricing">Pricing Page</a> --> Pricing Page or our Partners Fee Schedule, which we may change from time to time. Changes to that schedule are effective after we provide you with at least 24 hours' notice by posting the changes on the Website. </p>
          <p>In addition, you are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Website, Referral Program, Mobile Application and Service (the "Taxes"). The Payment Merchant is responsible for all areas associated with collecting money and payouts.  You will not hold Promo responsible for lost, delayed, or frozen payments. </p>


          <h4>Promo Referral Program</h4>
          
          <p>As a Member, by referring your friends, readers, or audience to purchase, Contact Seller, Contact Owner, or create a Promo that receives a confirmed purchase via the Site, Application and Services, you may participate in the “Referral Program”, which is a program we offer to "Select Partners". If you choose to participate in the Referral Program, for each person that successfully purchases a product ("Referral Purchase") or contact a Seller ("Referral Lead") via your unique promo url will receive a Referral Fee that equates to a flat fee or percentage of each transaction sold.</p>

          <p>In order to receive Referral Fees you must complete an application and vetting process to enter the program. Users may apply and find out more details by contacting our <a href="http://promo.co/support">support team</a> directly.</p>

          <p>In order to receive a Referral Fee, each of the following requirements must be met (collectively, a “Qualifying Referral Fee”): (i) an active Promo Referral Account; (ii) you must share the link provided with friends via Social Networks, by copying and pasting the unique referral link generated via the Services, by sending the unique referral link generated via the Services in an email via the Services to your friends; embedding the promo on websites, or by using the other tools provided by Promo to share the unique referral link with friends; (iii) viewers who clicks the link on websites or otherwise or clicks the link contained in the email must complete a transaction (purchase promotion or message Promo owner); and (iv) the confirmed booking via the Services with Total Fees of at least twenty-five dollars ($25) that is not subsequently cancelled.</p> 

          <p>Please note that you may not be the Seller or the Buyer for the promotion to receive a Referral Reward.</p>

          <p>Satisfaction of a Qualifying Referral Fee you receive will be reflected in your Promo Account in a commercially reasonable amount of time after the Qualifying Referral Fee has been completed. The Referral Program can be accrued solely by you and you may not earn Referral Fee by permitting another individual to use your Promo Account. Referral Fee Rewards accrued in multiple Promo Accounts may not be combined into one Promo Account. You may not earn Referral Fees by creating multiple Promo Accounts. Except as explicitly provided herein, Referral Fees are non-transferable. Members are responsible for keeping track of the Referral Rewards in their Promo Accounts</p>


          <h4>Cancellations, Exhanges, and Refunds </h4>
          

          <p>If, as a Buyer, you wish to cancel, refund, or exchange your purchase, you must contact the original Seller to verify refund and exchange policies. </p>



          <h4>Foreign Currency </h4>
          
          <p>If the currency in which you will be charged is different from the currency chosen by the Promoter/Seller to receive payment, the Business and Merchant Account will be responsible for the required currency conversion processing, including the costs thereof, which will be calculated based on the most current applicable foreign exchange rate that Business Owner has uploaded to the Site as of the date and time that your booking is confirmed (the “Applicable Exchange Rate”). You acknowledge that the Applicable Exchange Rate used for currency conversion processing may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time such processing occurs because: (i) Promo does not update currency rates on a real-time basis; and (ii) the Applicable Exchange Rate may include an incremental cost or margin that is not included in the applicable market rate.</p>
